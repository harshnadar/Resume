\section{EXPERIENCE}

{\customcventry{May 2021 - July 2021 (Ongoing)}{Software Engineer Intern}{Bank of New York Mellon}{Remote}{}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Working on shifting the tech-stack from Quartz Scheduler to Spring Scheduler as a part of CCT (Clearance and Collateral Technology) team.
  \item Quartz updates are to be done manually. This leads to unnecessary workload on the tech staff. Spring Scheduler, however, updates automatically on updating the Spring version.
  \item Working on Low-Level Design including table design, service layer and code structure.
  \item Exposure: Spring Boot, Maven, Spring Scheduler, Spring Data JPA
\end{itemize}
}

{\customcventry{April 2020 – Aug 2020}{Data Intern}{ISB Hyderabad}{Remote}{}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked under Prof. Anand Vijayasankaran on his project on Organisational Behavior.
  \item Ascertained and defined various sources to extract data suitable for the research objective. Used web scraping techniques to extract useful information related to CEO/CFO/CTOs and companies from various sources like Wikipedia, Glassdoor, Mergentonline, etc.
  \item Worked on thousands of downloaded text files to extract information. Used Regex in python and preprocessed the same into a data frame ready for analysis.
  \item Exposure - Web automation, Web scraping, Regex, Data Preprocessing
\end{itemize}
}

\section{PROJECTS}

{\customcvproject{\href{https://github.com/harshnadar/IPL_Dashboard}{IPL Dashboard}}{May 2021 - June 2021}
  {\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a Full Stack Web App. The app has features to browse through favourite IPL team and get details of its previous matches: accessible by team name and year.
    % \item  Used data from Kaggle.
    \item Exposure: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Batch, HSQL DB, React JS
  \end{itemize}
  }

{\customcvproject{\href{https://github.com/harshnadar/Cascade-Cup-Final-Round}{Cascade Cup}}{Dec 2020 – Jan 2021}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item The Event was organized by Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT G in association with Trell. The event took place in 3 rounds. Round 1 being data analytics and data science quiz.
  \item In Round 2, we're given Real Life data by Trell. Prepared a predictive model to predict the age group of their users.
  \item Round 3 was Data Analysis Eveent. We're given data of a courier company in Brazil and had to do analysis of absenteeism in the company. Did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and came up with inferences and hypothesis and backed them up with data.
  \item Exposure: Data Science, Predictive Modelling, Data Preprocessing, Tree Algorithms, EDA
\end{itemize}
}

{\customcvproject{\href{https://github.com/harshnadar/Codefest_enigma}{Predict Citation Count for Research Papers}}{Aug 2019 – Aug 2019}
{\begin{itemize}
  \item Train.csv - This had research papers with several attributes and their citation counts.
  Author.csv- Each research paper had several authors and various attributes about these were given in this.
  \item Feature Engineering - For a particular research paper, used author data to gather the top 3 common interest fields for all the authors in that particular paper.
  \item Model - Converted the top 3 topics for each paper to an embedded vector of 8 dimensions Then applied a simple neural model with activation function "selu"
\end{itemize}
